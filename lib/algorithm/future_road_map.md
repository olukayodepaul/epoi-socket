Here’s a concise roadmap to evolve your current system toward a **WhatsApp/Google-scale presence system**:

---

### **Phase 1 — Core Functionality (You Already Have)**

- Device-level aggregation per user.
- User status derived from all devices.
- Owner override via `awareness_intention`.
- Stale device detection using `last_seen`.
- Heartbeat via `PONG`.
- Event broadcasting via SubPub.

✅ This is fully functional for small- to medium-scale deployments.

---

### **Phase 2 — Reliability & Scale**

- **Distributed Presence Nodes**

  - Deploy multiple nodes per region to handle global load.
  - Use `Node.connect/1` or a distributed cache for device states.

- **Persistent Store**

  - Use Redis, Cassandra, or Mnesia for replicated presence state.
  - Survive node restarts without losing user/device info.

- **Stale Device Optimization**

  - Adaptive `last_seen` thresholds based on device type or network conditions.

---

### **Phase 3 — Event Delivery Optimization**

- **Efficient Fan-out**

  - Batch updates to subscribers to reduce network load.
  - Use lightweight protocols (MQTT, WebSocket with compression).

- **Subscriber Visibility**

  - Respect per-contact privacy rules.
  - Optional “last seen” visibility and DND modes.

- **Delta Updates**

  - Send only changes to devices instead of full status each time.

---

### **Phase 4 — Advanced Features**

- **Device heuristics**

  - Track app background/foreground, network type, and OS-level signals.

- **Intelligent Offline Detection**

  - Combine owner intention + network health + heartbeat + device type.

- **Analytics & Monitoring**

  - Real-time dashboards for active devices, missed pongs, and system health.

---

✅ **Summary:**

- **You already have Phase 1 solid.**
- Phase 2–4 adds **scalability, reliability, efficiency, and advanced user experience**, like Google/WhatsApp.

If you want, I can also **sketch a diagram showing how your Mother GenServer + SubPub + device aggregation fits into a global distributed presence system**. This helps visualize scaling.

Do you want me to do that?
