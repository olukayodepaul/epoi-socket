Perfect! Let’s break it down into a clear **itemized specification** for the **Device Aggregator Tunnel (DAT)** inside the **Mother GenServer**. This will serve as a blueprint before any code.

---

## **Device Aggregator Tunnel (DAT) – Responsibilities**

### **1️⃣ Manage Subscriber Presence**

- Track **subscribers** for each device.
- Record **last_seen timestamp** and **status** (`active` / `inactive` / `allow` / `deny`).
- Only subscribers with **active status** and recent activity are considered for broadcast.

### **2️⃣ Broadcast Device Updates**

- Receive **device events** (e.g., pong, message, status change) from devices.
- Check the **subscriber list** for that device.
- **Send updates only to active subscribers**.
- Skip broadcasting if **no active subscribers exist**.

### **3️⃣ Subscriber Lifecycle Management**

- **Add subscribers** when they subscribe to a device.
- **Update last_seen** on subscriber activity.
- **Mark inactive or remove subscribers** exceeding thresholds or inactivity.
- Optionally, **notify subscribers of removal** (if needed).

### **4️⃣ Device Lifecycle Awareness**

- Maintain **device presence info** (status, last activity, etc.).
- Associate **subscribers with devices** so broadcasts are targeted.
- Clean up device entries when **no subscribers remain** or device is terminated.

### **5️⃣ Aggregator Tunnel Logic**

- Acts as a **central hub per device** inside Mother.
- Maintains **internal mapping**: device → subscribers → presence info.
- Handles **batch broadcast** efficiently for multiple subscribers.
- Ensures **thread-safe state** since multiple devices and subscribers can update concurrently.

### **6️⃣ Thresholds & Cleanup**

- Define **maximum inactivity duration** for subscribers.
- Automatically **remove subscribers** exceeding this duration.
- Optionally, **remove stale device entries** if no subscribers are attached.

### **7️⃣ Event Prioritization (Optional)**

- Decide if certain events have **higher priority** for broadcast.
- Prioritize certain subscribers if needed (e.g., VIP clients).

---

### **Summary**

In short, the tunnel will:

1. Track subscriber presence per device.
2. Filter only active subscribers for broadcasts.
3. Broadcast device events efficiently.
4. Remove inactive subscribers automatically.
5. Optionally handle device cleanup and event prioritization.

---

If you want, we can **also draw a table showing all events, triggers, and how the DAT should react**—like a functional spec sheet. This makes it extremely clear for implementation.

Do you want me to do that next?

Absolutely! Let’s define a clear **scope of implementation** for the **Device Aggregator Tunnel (DAT)**. This will serve as a blueprint, setting boundaries for what the system will and won’t do in the first version.

---

## **Scope of Implementation: Device Aggregator Tunnel (DAT)**

### **1️⃣ Purpose**

- Centralize management of **devices** and their **subscribers**.
- Efficiently broadcast **device updates** (presence, messages, events) to **active subscribers only**.
- Automatically clean up **inactive subscribers** to maintain system health and scalability.

---

### **2️⃣ Functional Scope**

The system will handle:

1. **Subscriber Management**

   - Track which subscribers are connected to which devices.
   - Maintain subscriber state: `active`, `inactive`, `allow`, `deny`.
   - Record last activity timestamp (`last_seen`) for cleanup.

2. **Device Management**

   - Track device presence and last activity.
   - Associate devices with their subscribers.
   - Handle incoming device events (pongs, messages, status updates).

3. **Broadcasting**

   - Send updates only to active subscribers.
   - Skip broadcasting if a device has no active subscribers.
   - Optionally batch broadcasts for efficiency.

4. **Cleanup & Thresholds**

   - Remove subscribers exceeding inactivity threshold.
   - Remove stale device entries if no subscribers remain.
   - Maintain internal consistency between device and subscriber states.

5. **Aggregator Tunnel Logic**

   - Maintain internal mapping: **device → subscribers → state**.
   - Act as a central hub for routing messages.
   - Ensure safe, concurrent updates to shared state.

---

### **3️⃣ Non-Functional Scope**

- **Performance:** Should handle thousands of devices and subscribers without significant delay.
- **Scalability:** Single centralized DAT, designed to later integrate with clustering or Pub/Sub for distributed systems.
- **Reliability:** Automatic cleanup of inactive subscribers prevents memory bloat.
- **Extensibility:** Future support for prioritization of subscribers or different message types.

---

### **4️⃣ Out of Scope (for initial implementation)**

- Per-device child GenServers (all logic resides in the central DAT).
- Distributed/multi-node broadcasting (initial version single-node).
- Persisting data to external databases (state remains in-memory or ETS).
- Complex prioritization or filtering beyond active/inactive subscribers.

---

### **5️⃣ Deliverables**

- Central **Device Aggregator Tunnel** implemented in the Mother/Hub server.
- Subscriber and device **state tracking** with cleanup logic.
- **Broadcast mechanism** that filters inactive subscribers.
- Documentation of **state model** and **event flows**.

---

If you want, I can also **draw a visual diagram of the implementation scope** showing: devices, subscribers, tunnel, broadcast, and cleanup flows. This usually makes the scope crystal clear for teams and stakeholders.

Do you want me to do that next?
